                Typography is more than just choosing a pretty font — 
                it’s what makes the difference between a reader staying or bouncing away. 
                As users scroll through endless content, text that’s well-aligned, well-spaced, 
                and beautifully styled can grab attention like a headline in ink.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                In this digital age, CSS gives designers the power to 
                fine-tune readability like never before. Properties such as line-height, text-indent, 
                and font-weight may seem small, but combined, they build rhythm and hierarchy. 
                The web might be built on code, but good design? That’s built on type.
